# Bookmark Search

Bookmark Search is a productivity tool. It's designed to help you manage your bookmarks more efficiently in Chrome.

It's available on [the Chrome Webstore!](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookmark-search/fcjphnojgeikgjajhlihdjnljnbpfhmi)

It uses both standard filtering and the [lunr](https://lunrjs.com/) project to power searching your bookmarks.

## Licence

GPL v2. See the LICENCE file. For a quick explaination, this summarises it quite well: https://tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-general-public-license-v2

## Installation

Either install from the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/bookmark-search/fcjphnojgeikgjajhlihdjnljnbpfhmi), or side-load it.

To side load:

- Download either as a zip (and extract), or through git.
- Open the chrome browser, go to `chrome://extensions`, click `Load unpacked extension`, navigate to the project folder, and select the 'src' folder.

The extension should then appear in Chrome with your other extensions.
