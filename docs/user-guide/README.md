You can find information about the my-view Chrome Extension here.

## Installation

Currently not available on the play store, to install this extension download either as a zip (and extract), or through git.

Then open the chrome browser, go to `chrome://extensions`, click `Load unpacked extension`, navigate to the project folder, and select the 'src' folder.

The extension should then appear in Chrome with your other extensions.

## Keyboard shortcuts

This application is designed with user speed in mind; its job is simple - to get you to your saved bookmark in as little time as possible.

That's why on loading the search area is focused so that you can start typing straight away, and when you see a result appear that you want to go to, you can use the `tab` key to navigate to it, and `enter` to open that link in a new tab.

You can also add a shortcut to open the extension, by going to `chrome://extensions`, going to the bottom of the page, clicking `Keyboard Shortcuts` and selecting a shortcut for `my-view` > `Activate the extension`.

Using these shortcuts means that you won't need to use a mouse and using the application will be very fast.
