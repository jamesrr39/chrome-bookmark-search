## Keyboard shortcuts

This application is designed with user speed in mind; its job is simple - to get you to your saved bookmark in as little time as possible.

That's why on loading the search area is focused so that you can start typing straight away, and when you see a result appear that you want to go to, you can use the `tab` key to navigate to it, and `enter` to open that link in a new tab.

You can also add a shortcut to open the extension, by going to `chrome://extensions`, going to the bottom of the page, clicking `Keyboard Shortcuts` and selecting a shortcut for `my-view` > `Activate the extension`.

Using these shortcuts means that you won't need to use a mouse and you will be able to use the application very quickly and efficiently.
